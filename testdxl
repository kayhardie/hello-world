/* 
Set the values of IsReq and Paragraph Style after importing a new DRD module - for TMT
March 2016

Description: 	This DXL script automatically populates the IsReq and Paragraph Style fields.
		This is intended to be run after importing a new DRD module.
		
Process:	This is the logic used:
		1) Requirements: object text starts with "[REQ-"
		2) Discussions: object text starts with "Discussion:"
		3) Figure Captions: object text starts with "Figure"
		4) Table Captions: object text starts with "Table"
		5) Headers: object heading is not empty
		6) DOORS tables: uses the cell(), row(), and table() functions
		7) intro sections: object number < "3"

		Requirements found inside DOORS table cells are handled differently.
		Continuing requirements and discussions retain the proper settings.
		Non table cells in the intro sections (1 & 2) are given Parargaph Style: Requirement
		only so they get the desired left indent.  IsReq is set to false.

		Each test in the dxl code ends with a "continue" statement, jumping to the
		next object in the module.  This speeds things up and makes the many IF statements
		behave almost like a CASE statement.

		The script counts the objects that are skipped and reports this to the user.

Assumptions:	The script requires the following conditions for proper function:
		1) The user has opened the desired module in exclusive edit mode.
	
Directions:	1) Open the desired DRD module in exclusive edit mode
		2) In that module window, select menu item: Tools / Edit DXL...
		3) Paste this script code into the dialog window and click "Run"

Notes:		1) The script does not save the module, the user should review the changes and 
		   save the module if satisfied.
		2) The output to the DXL dialog window ends with a list of actions for the
			user to perform manually.
